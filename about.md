Randhawa Inc. builds and analyzes technology for the real world. My decade plus long experience includes AI, analytics, and digital infrastructure at places like Apple, Shell, and the U.S. Treasury. I have invested in and advised startups (Kift, Gumroad, Roam, Customer.io among others), scaled software for Fortune 100s from scratch, and mentored thousands of new entrepreneurs. A Supply Chain graduate from the University of Houston, I am trained at Wolfram Research, New England Complex Systems Institute, and Real World Risk Institute.
