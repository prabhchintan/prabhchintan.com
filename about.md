Randhawa Inc., founded by Prabhchintan 'Prab' Randhawa in 2021, operates as a logistics and digital transformation firm based out of Sheridan, Wyoming, with services spanning across Texas cities like Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. Specializing in the delivery of freight and heavy industry materials, Randhawa Inc. also provides cutting-edge digital solutions, including software engineering, consulting, and data science for companies like Scale AI. The company further ventures into the realm of digital assets, running Ethereum validators and contributing to decentralized finance via protocols such as RocketPool.

The Randhawa clan, from which Prab descends, has a deep-rooted history in the Punjab region, particularly among the Jatt community, known for their agrarian lifestyle and warrior traditions. Emerging as influential landowners and zamindars by the 10th and 11th centuries, the Randhawas, like other Jatt clans, solidified their status in the Majha region of Punjab, historically significant for its fertile lands and proximity to the Sikh heartland. The clan’s martial valor came to the fore during the rise of Sikhism in the 15th century and the formation of the Khalsa in 1699, under which many Randhawas served in the military forces resisting Mughal and Afghan invasions.

As Punjab entered the modern era, the Randhawa clan maintained its prominence, especially during the British colonial period, where they adapted to the emerging agrarian economy under the zamindari system and contributed heavily to the British Indian Army. Post-partition, the Randhawas, both in India and Pakistan, continued to thrive, engaging in agriculture, entrepreneurship, and increasingly, in the professional and technological sectors—mirroring Prab's own entrepreneurial journey in logistics, technology, and finance.
