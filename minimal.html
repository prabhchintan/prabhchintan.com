    <h1>Significant Equations in Mathematics</h1>
    <p>Mathematics has shaped our understanding of the universe for centuries. Throughout history, certain equations have stood out for their elegance, power, and impact on science and technology. Here are a few of the most significant equations, explained simply and presented in a minimal, readable style.</p>
    <h2>Pythagorean Theorem</h2>
    <p>One of the earliest and most famous equations, the Pythagorean theorem relates the sides of a right triangle:</p>
    <div class="eq">a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></div>
    <p>This equation is fundamental in geometry and appears in countless applications, from architecture to physics.</p>
    <h2>Euler’s Identity</h2>
    <p>Often called the most beautiful equation in mathematics, Euler’s identity links five fundamental constants:</p>
    <div class="eq">e<sup>iπ</sup> + 1 = 0</div>
    <p>This compact formula connects the exponential function, imaginary numbers, pi, one, and zero in a single elegant statement.</p>
    <h2>Quadratic Formula</h2>
    <p>The quadratic formula provides the solution to any quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0:</p>
    <div class="eq">x = ( -b ± √(b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac) ) / 2a</div>
    <p>This formula is a staple in algebra and is used to solve a wide range of problems.</p>
    <h2>Einstein’s Mass-Energy Equivalence</h2>
    <p>Einstein’s famous equation from the theory of relativity expresses the relationship between mass and energy:</p>
    <div class="eq">E = mc<sup>2</sup></div>
    <p>This equation revolutionized physics and led to profound technological advances.</p>
    <h2>Schrödinger Equation</h2>
    <p>In quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time:</p>
    <div class="eq">iħ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ</div>
    <p>It is central to our understanding of atomic and subatomic processes.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>These equations are just a glimpse into the rich tapestry of mathematics. Each has played a pivotal role in advancing human knowledge, and their simplicity belies the depth of their impact.</p>
