    <h1>Significant Equations in Mathematics</h1>
    <p>Mathematics is a language of patterns, logic, and abstraction. Its equations have not only described the world but have also predicted phenomena far before they were observed. In this blog, we explore some of the most influential equations, from the simple to the complex, and see how they have shaped our understanding of reality.</p>
    <p>From the earliest civilizations, humans have used mathematics to solve practical problems. Over time, this evolved into a sophisticated discipline, with equations that can describe everything from the motion of planets to the behavior of subatomic particles. The beauty of mathematics lies in its universality and its ability to express profound truths with elegant symbols.</p>
    <h2>Pythagorean Theorem</h2>
    <p>One of the earliest and most famous equations, the Pythagorean theorem relates the sides of a right triangle:</p>
    <div class="eq">a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></div>
    <p>This equation is fundamental in geometry and appears in countless applications, from architecture to physics. Its simplicity and power have made it a cornerstone of mathematical education for centuries.</p>
    <h2>Euler's Identity</h2>
    <p>Often called the most beautiful equation in mathematics, Euler's identity links five fundamental constants:</p>
    <div class="eq">e<sup>iπ</sup> + 1 = 0</div>
    <p>This compact formula connects the exponential function, imaginary numbers, pi, one, and zero in a single elegant statement. It is celebrated for its mathematical beauty and depth.</p>
    <h2>Quadratic Formula</h2>
    <p>The quadratic formula provides the solution to any quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0:</p>
    <div class="eq">x = ( -b ± √(b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac) ) / 2a</div>
    <p>This formula is a staple in algebra and is used to solve a wide range of problems, from physics to engineering. Its derivation is a classic exercise in completing the square.</p>
    <h2>Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence</h2>
    <p>Einstein's famous equation from the theory of relativity expresses the relationship between mass and energy:</p>
    <div class="eq">E = mc<sup>2</sup></div>
    <p>This equation revolutionized physics and led to profound technological advances, including nuclear power and our understanding of the universe's energy content.</p>
    <h2>Schrödinger Equation</h2>
    <p>In quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time:</p>
    <div class="eq">iħ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ</div>
    <p>It is central to our understanding of atomic and subatomic processes, providing a framework for predicting the behavior of particles at the smallest scales.</p>
    <h2>Navier–Stokes Equation</h2>
    <p>The Navier–Stokes equations describe the motion of fluid substances such as liquids and gases. In their general form, they are quite complex:</p>
    <div class="eq">ρ ( ∂<b>u</b>/∂t + <b>u</b> · ∇<b>u</b> ) = −∇p + μ∇<sup>2</sup><b>u</b> + <b>f</b></div>
    <p>These equations are fundamental in fluid dynamics and are used to model weather, ocean currents, and airflow around aircraft.</p>
    <h2>Maxwell's Equations (Integral Form)</h2>
    <p>Maxwell's equations unify electricity and magnetism. In integral form, they are:</p>
    <div class="eq">
      ∮<sub>S</sub> <b>E</b> · d<b>A</b> = Q/ε₀<br>
      ∮<sub>S</sub> <b>B</b> · d<b>A</b> = 0<br>
      ∮<sub>C</sub> <b>E</b> · d<b>l</b> = −dΦ<sub>B</sub>/dt<br>
      ∮<sub>C</sub> <b>B</b> · d<b>l</b> = μ₀I + μ₀ε₀ dΦ<sub>E</sub>/dt
    </div>
    <p>These equations are the foundation of classical electromagnetism, optics, and electric circuits.</p>
    <h2>Black–Scholes Equation</h2>
    <p>In finance, the Black–Scholes equation is used to model the price of options over time:</p>
    <div class="eq">∂V/∂t + ½σ<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>∂<sup>2</sup>V/∂S<sup>2</sup> + rS∂V/∂S − rV = 0</div>
    <p>This equation has had a major impact on modern financial markets and risk management.</p>
    <h2>Riemann Hypothesis (ζ Function)</h2>
    <p>The Riemann Hypothesis, one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, concerns the zeros of the Riemann zeta function:</p>
    <div class="eq">ζ(s) = ∑<sub>n=1</sub><sup>∞</sup> 1/n<sup>s</sup></div>
    <p>It is deeply connected to the distribution of prime numbers and remains a central question in number theory.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>From the simplicity of the Pythagorean theorem to the complexity of the Navier–Stokes and Black–Scholes equations, mathematics offers a rich landscape of ideas. These equations, with their Greek letters, symbols, and intricate forms, are not just tools—they are milestones in humanity's quest to understand the universe.</p>
