# Samurai Blogging System

This is the first post using our new samurai blogging system. The system is designed to be brutally minimal while providing maximum power and flexibility.

## Features

- **Single packet loading** for index.html
- **Slug-based URLs** like `/samurai_blogging`
- **Automatic date parsing** from filename
- **SEO optimized** with meta tags
- **Future extensible** for tags, categories, search

## Writing Flow

1. Write in markdown: `nano posts/2025_01_15_my_post.md`
2. Publish with one command: `randhawa`
3. Post is live at `/my_post`

The system maintains our beautiful minimal design while providing the power of a full CMS. Every post gets the same academic, polished styling that we've perfected.

## Technical Details

- Built with Python for maximum control
- Template system for consistency
- Git integration for version control
- Cloudflare compatible for fast hosting

This is the future of minimal blogging.
