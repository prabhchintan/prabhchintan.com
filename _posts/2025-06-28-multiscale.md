## Fundamental Concepts

### Overview of Multiscale Modeling

Multiscale modeling is a powerful framework utilized in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to analyze complex systems by integrating models that operate at different length and time scales. Generally, multiscale models can be classified into sequential and concurrent models. Sequential multiscale models use high-resolution molecular-scale data to derive parameters necessary for larger-scale models, such as those at the organelle level, facilitating a detailed understanding of biochemical processes.[8]

While this approach is prevalent, it is often accompanied by increased uncertainty due to potential information loss during the transfer of parameters across scales.

### Computational Methods

The realm of CFD encompasses various computational methods that aim to solve the governing equations of fluid motion, often characterized by their complexity. These methods typically fall into two categories: Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. The Eulerian method analyzes fluid behavior at fixed spatial locations, making it advantageous for problems involving complex boundary interactions and steady-state flows. In contrast, the Lagrangian method tracks the motion of individual fluid particles, providing insights into the dynamics of fluid movement.[6]

The traditional numerical methods in CFD, such as the finite difference method (FDM), finite volume method (FVM), and finite element method (FEM), are employed to discretize fluid domains. FDM approximates derivatives through finite differences, while FVM conserves physical quantities across discrete control volumes. FEM minimizes errors by applying variational principles across interconnected elements, which is particularly beneficial for handling complex geometries.[9]

### Challenges in Multiscale Modeling

One of the significant challenges in multiscale modeling is accurately capturing the interactions between vastly different scales. For instance, microscopic molecular dynamics can greatly influence macroscopic properties such as viscosity and turbulence in fluid flows.[6]

This complexity is exacerbated by limited high-fidelity data availability and computational resources. However, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as pivotal tools in bridging the gap in data scarcity, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of multiscale models.

### Incorporating Physical Laws

Integrating fundamental physical laws governing fluid dynamics into multiscale models presents another challenge. Approaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed physical laws within the neural network’s loss function, whereas explicit physical knowledge encoding involves directly incorporating these laws into the model framework.[6]

This integration is crucial for enhancing the predictive capability and reliability of multiscale models in CFD applications.

## Methodologies

### Molecular Simulation Approaches

Molecular simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) have been instrumental in exploring the structure, thermodynamics, and dynamics of micro/nanofluid systems. Despite their effectiveness, the atomistic simulation of constrained fluids can be computationally intensive, particularly when addressing larger systems with complex boundaries.[8]

To address these challenges, mesoscopic, coarse-grained (CG) models have been introduced, allowing for the incorporation of particles that are sufficiently large for external hydrodynamic forces to impact their dynamics while still being small enough that thermal (Brownian) forces are significant.[8]

### Multiscale Simulation Framework

In this context, a multiscale simulation framework employing twin neural networks (NNs) has been proposed to bridge the gap between microscale and mesoscale modeling. Using petroleum's primary component, octane, as a case study, initial simulations at the atomistic level serve as the foundation for constructing a CG model, with the first NN acting as a surrogate for the CG interaction potential. This interaction potential is integrated into a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) framework, where atomistic data is also utilized to estimate necessary parameters related to dynamical properties such as dissipation and noise. Subsequently, DPD simulations generate fluid dynamics data for constrained octane fluid under shear conditions with intricate boundary conditions. This data is then employed to train a second NN capable of predicting the fluid's velocity profile under similar conditions, facilitating a transformation from Lagrangian to Eulerian descriptions for the fluid.[8]

### Coarse-Grained Dynamics

The focus of this study is a small molecule, which exhibits simpler diffusion behavior compared to more complex fluids. Consequently, the CG dynamics have been optimized using the standard DPD approach, which Enemies the forces acting on CG sites and categorizes nonconservative forces into velocity-dependent dissipative friction and stochastic terms, adhering to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.[8]

Although the CG interaction potential can replicate reference energy and/or force, it is essential to enhance the equation of motion at the CG level with additional terms to accurately reproduce dynamical properties, including the diffusion coefficient. The dynamics derived from MD simulations at the atomic scale can be represented at the CG level through a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) framework.[8]

### Turbulence Modeling Techniques

In the field of computational fluid dynamics, various turbulence modeling approaches have evolved, including Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations, which are among the oldest methods for modeling turbulence. RANS equations solve an ensemble version of governing equations, introducing Reynolds stresses, which are second-order tensors of unknowns that various models can address with differing levels of closure. This method can also be adapted to statistically unsteady flows, referred to as unsteady RANS (URANS).[10]

### Other Modeling Approaches

RANS models can be broadly classified into several methodologies, including Boussinesq hypothesis, compressible and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and direct numerical simulation (DNS), which resolves the entire turbulent length scale at a high computational cost. Alternatively, large eddy simulation (LES) and detached eddy simulation approaches utilize filtering operations to resolve larger scales of turbulence while modeling the effects of smaller scales, offering a balance between accuracy and computational expense.[10]

Additionally, the linear eddy model is employed to simulate convective mixing in turbulent flows, providing high-resolution predictions applicable across diverse flow conditions and serving as a foundational component for more intricate flow representations.[10]
