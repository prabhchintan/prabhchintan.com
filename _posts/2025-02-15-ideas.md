## Half-baked ideas

1. Time and Space:
    Lots of models tend to view time as the main function, but new paradigm physics dictates space as the main function and time as a measure of steps taken for the space to evolve.

2. Path Dependence:
    Marxism assumes Capitalism gives birth to Socialism, but in reality it's the opposite.

3. Scale:
    Another way to look at space is scale. As systems grow, new ways to manage them must upkeep with scale.
