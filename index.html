<p>Hi, this is Prabhchintan Randhawa.</p>

<p>I also go by Prab, Prabh, and Chintu. 
This site is <a href="https://github.com/prabhchintan/prabhchintan.com">open-source</a> 
and a continual work in progress. 
Visit again to check for updates.</p>

<p>
    I make technology and I trade.
    Previously, I have created products at Shell, sold technology at Apple, and analyzed data for the U.S. Treasury.
    I graduated from the University of Houston with a Supply Chain degree, and have self-studied Complexity, Math, Physics, and Philosophy for a number of years now.
    I'm an amateur programmer but speak fluent English, Punjabi, and Hindi.
    I also like to cook.
