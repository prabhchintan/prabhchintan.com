<h1>ੴ</h1>
<p>Hi, this is Prabhchintan Randhawa. I also go by Prab, Prabh, and Chintu.</p>

<p> 
This is an <a href="https://github.com/prabhchintan/prabhchintan.com">open-source</a> website made with HTML, CSS, and Python. 
It is my playground for science & technology experimentation, and thus a continual work in progress. I'm working on a blog that should be ready soon. 
Check back for updates.</p>

<p>
    Professionally, I make technology and trade.
    I have previously created products at Shell, sold computers at Apple, and analyzed data for the U.S. Treasury.
    I studied Supply Chain at the University of Houston, and self-studied Complexity, Math, Physics, Philosophy, and Programming after.
    I am fluent in English, Punjabi, Hindi, and Urdu.
    Sometimes I produce music. I also like to cook, watch movies, and travel.
</p>

Here is my <a href="https://github.com/prabhchintan">GitHub</a>,
