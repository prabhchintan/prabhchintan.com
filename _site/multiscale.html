This capability is essential for optimizing pipeline flows, enhancing multiphase flow predictions, and improving infrastructure design. Moreover, the integration of machine learning techniques into CFD has further refined these models, enabling real-time analysis and decision-making, which is critical in the fast-paced oil supply environment.(3)</p>

<p>The development of such sophisticated modeling frameworks not only increases operational efficiency but also supports the industry’s shift towards sustainable practices by assessing environmental risks associated with oil spills and gas leaks.(5)</p>

<p>Despite its advantages, the implementation of multi-scale CFD in oil supply chains faces notable challenges. High costs associated with technology integration, computational complexity, and the need for interdisciplinary approaches present significant barriers to widespread adoption. Additionally, the integration of advanced machine learning techniques raises concerns regarding accuracy and overfitting in predictive models.(6)</p>

<p>Addressing these challenges is essential for maximizing the potential of multi-scale CFD to transform the oil supply chain sector, ensuring both economic viability and compliance with stringent environmental regulations. The future of multi-scale CFD in oil supply chains appears promising, driven by continuous advancements in computational methods and an increasing emphasis on sustainability. As the demand for more efficient and environmentally friendly operations grows, the role of multi-scale CFD is likely to expand, shaping the landscape of oil supply chain management for years to come.(8)</p>

<h2 id="historical-background">Historical Background</h2>

<p>The development of multi-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for oil supply chains has evolved significantly from its early days, marked by limitations in computational power and the reliance on simplified equations to simulate fluid behavior. In the nascent stages of computational modeling, chemical engineers utilized empirical correlations and hand calculations to estimate fluid properties and flow, which, despite their limitations, laid the groundwork for future advancements in the field(1).</p>

<p>These foundational efforts provided valuable insights into fluid dynamics, which encompasses the study of fluids in motion—including liquids, gases, and plasmas—and is rooted in the principles of mass, momentum, and energy conservation(1). As computational capabilities improved, the focus shifted towards more sophisticated modeling techniques that could better capture the complexities of fluid behavior. The introduction of advanced methods such as Large Eddy Simulation marked a pivotal point in turbulence modeling, providing researchers with tools to analyze turbulent flow patterns more accurately(2).</p>

<p>Over time, multi-scale modeling frameworks began to emerge, integrating surface chemistry with ambient fluid behavior to enhance the understanding of hydrodynamics in various applications, including fluid-particle separation processes(3)(4). Recent developments in machine learning have further transformed the landscape of CFD, enabling the exploration of novel methodologies such as deep kernel learning for coarse-grained density functional theory predictions(5). The promising performance of diffusion models in various design tasks suggests that these methods may become mainstream for inverse design in the future(6).</p>

<p>This ongoing evolution in computational fluid dynamics underscores the necessity for continuous adaptation and innovation within the oil supply chain context, especially given the complex multiphase conditions that influence production dynamics and transient sand production periods(7). As the field progresses, researchers and engineers are increasingly equipped to analyze and optimize fluid behavior in real-time, leading to improved operational efficiencies and enhanced decision-making processes in oil supply chains.</p>

<h2 id="fundamental-concepts">Fundamental Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="overview-of-multiscale-modeling">Overview of Multiscale Modeling</h3>

<p>Multiscale modeling is a powerful framework utilized in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to analyze complex systems by integrating models that operate at different length and time scales. Generally, multiscale models can be classified into sequential and concurrent models. Sequential multiscale models use high-resolution molecular-scale data to derive parameters necessary for larger-scale models, such as those at the organelle level, facilitating a detailed understanding of biochemical processes(8).</p>

<p>While this approach is prevalent, it is often accompanied by increased uncertainty due to potential information loss during the transfer of parameters across scales.</p>

<h3 id="computational-methods">Computational Methods</h3>

<p>The realm of CFD encompasses various computational methods that aim to solve the governing equations of fluid motion, often characterized by their complexity. These methods typically fall into two categories: Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. The Eulerian method analyzes fluid behavior at fixed spatial locations, making it advantageous for problems involving complex boundary interactions and steady-state flows. In contrast, the Lagrangian method tracks the motion of individual fluid particles, providing insights into the dynamics of fluid movement(6).</p>

<p>The traditional numerical methods in CFD, such as the finite difference method (FDM), finite volume method (FVM), and finite element method (FEM), are employed to discretize fluid domains. FDM approximates derivatives through finite differences, while FVM conserves physical quantities across discrete control volumes. FEM minimizes errors by applying variational principles across interconnected elements, which is particularly beneficial for handling complex geometries(9)(10).</p>

<h3 id="challenges-in-multiscale-modeling">Challenges in Multiscale Modeling</h3>

<p>One of the significant challenges in multiscale modeling is accurately capturing the interactions between vastly different scales. For instance, microscopic molecular dynamics can greatly influence macroscopic properties such as viscosity and turbulence in fluid flows(6). This complexity is exacerbated by limited high-fidelity data availability and computational resources. However, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as pivotal tools in bridging the gap in data scarcity, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of multiscale models.</p>

<h3 id="incorporating-physical-laws">Incorporating Physical Laws</h3>

<p>Integrating fundamental physical laws governing fluid dynamics into multiscale models presents another challenge. Approaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed physical laws within the neural network’s loss function, whereas explicit physical knowledge encoding involves directly incorporating these laws into the model framework(6). This integration is crucial for enhancing the predictive capability and reliability of multiscale models in CFD applications.</p>

<h2 id="applications-in-oil-supply-chains">Applications in Oil Supply Chains</h2>

<h3 id="overview-of-computational-fluid-dynamics-in-oil-supply-chains">Overview of Computational Fluid Dynamics in Oil Supply Chains</h3>

<p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) plays a critical role in optimizing various aspects of oil supply chains, particularly in modeling fluid behavior and enhancing the efficiency of oil transport systems. The ability to simulate complex flow dynamics allows for significant improvements in infrastructure design and operational efficiency, which are vital for maximizing profitability and minimizing environmental impacts in the oil industry(11)(12).</p>

<h3 id="fluid-flow-optimization">Fluid Flow Optimization</h3>

<p>One of the primary applications of CFD in oil supply chains is the optimization of fluid flow within pipelines. For instance, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System serves as a benchmark for how small enhancements in flow efficiency can result in substantial financial savings. Techniques such as strategic placement of pumping stations and optimization of pipeline diameter are influenced by advanced fluid flow analysis, showcasing the economic advantages of CFD applications(13).</p>

<h3 id="multiphase-flow-modeling">Multiphase Flow Modeling</h3>

<p>CFD is particularly effective in multiphase flow modeling, which is essential for understanding the interactions of oil, gas, and water within pipelines. By employing CFD simulation tools, engineers can predict the behavior of solid particles in pipelines and mitigate erosion damage, thereby enhancing the lifespan and reliability of oil transport infrastructure(14)(12). These simulations can also model oil/water separation in horizontal pipelines, providing critical data on water wetting probabilities on carbon steel surfaces, which can impact corrosion rates and overall pipeline integrity(15).</p>

<h3 id="environmental-impact-assessment">Environmental Impact Assessment</h3>

<p>Another vital application of CFD within oil supply chains is in the assessment and management of environmental risks associated with oil spills and gas leaks. By simulating fluid behavior, CFD models can predict the dispersion of pollutants, enabling more effective emergency response strategies and pollution control measures(16). This predictive capability is essential for minimizing the ecological impacts of oil operations and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations(17).</p>

<h3 id="design-and-risk-mitigation">Design and Risk Mitigation</h3>

<p>CFD aids in the design of offshore oil rigs and other critical infrastructure by simulating the impact of environmental factors such as wind and water currents. This allows for the assessment of climate-induced risks and informs necessary design modifications to enhance operational safety and efficiency(18). By preemptively analyzing potential complications, operators can implement mitigation measures, which is especially crucial in harsh operating conditions common in offshore environments(18).</p>

<h2 id="methodologies">Methodologies</h2>

<h3 id="molecular-simulation-approaches">Molecular Simulation Approaches</h3>

<p>Molecular simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) have been instrumental in exploring the structure, thermodynamics, and dynamics of micro/nanofluid systems. Despite their effectiveness, the atomistic simulation of constrained fluids can be computationally intensive, particularly when addressing larger systems with complex boundaries(8). To address these challenges, mesoscopic, coarse-grained (CG) models have been introduced, allowing for the incorporation of particles that are sufficiently large for external hydrodynamic forces to impact their dynamics while still being small enough that thermal (Brownian) forces are significant(8).</p>

<h3 id="multiscale-simulation-framework">Multiscale Simulation Framework</h3>

<p>In this context, a multiscale simulation framework employing twin neural networks (NNs) has been proposed to bridge the gap between microscale and mesoscale modeling. Using petroleum’s primary component, octane, as a case study, initial simulations at the atomistic level serve as the foundation for constructing a CG model, with the first NN acting as a surrogate for the CG interaction potential. This interaction potential is integrated into a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) framework, where atomistic data is also utilized to estimate necessary parameters related to dynamical properties such as dissipation and noise. Subsequently, DPD simulations generate fluid dynamics data for constrained octane fluid under shear conditions with intricate boundary conditions. This data is then employed to train a second NN capable of predicting the fluid’s velocity profile under similar conditions, facilitating a transformation from Lagrangian to Eulerian descriptions for the fluid(8).</p>

<h3 id="coarse-grained-dynamics">Coarse-Grained Dynamics</h3>

<p>The focus of this study is a small molecule, which exhibits simpler diffusion behavior compared to more complex fluids. Consequently, the CG dynamics have been optimized using the standard DPD approach, which delineates the forces acting on CG sites and categorizes nonconservative forces into velocity-dependent dissipative friction and stochastic terms, adhering to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem(8). Although the CG interaction potential can replicate reference energy and/or force, it is essential to enhance the equation of motion at the CG level with additional terms to accurately reproduce dynamical properties, including the diffusion coefficient. The dynamics derived from MD simulations at the atomic scale can be represented at the CG level through a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) framework(8).</p>

<h3 id="turbulence-modeling-techniques">Turbulence Modeling Techniques</h3>

<p>In the field of computational fluid dynamics, various turbulence modeling approaches have evolved, including Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations, which are among the oldest methods for modeling turbulence. RANS equations solve an ensemble version of governing equations, introducing Reynolds stresses, which are second-order tensors of unknowns that various models can address with differing levels of closure. This method can also be adapted to statistically unsteady flows, referred to as unsteady RANS (URANS)(10).</p>

<h3 id="other-modeling-approaches">Other Modeling Approaches</h3>

<p>RANS models can be broadly classified into several methodologies, including Boussinesq hypothesis, compressible and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and direct numerical simulation (DNS), which resolves the entire turbulent length scale at a high computational cost. Alternatively, large eddy simulation (LES) and detached eddy simulation approaches utilize filtering operations to resolve larger scales of turbulence while modeling the effects of smaller scales, offering a balance between accuracy and computational expense(10). Additionally, the linear eddy model is employed to simulate convective mixing in turbulent flows, providing high-resolution predictions applicable across diverse flow conditions and serving as a foundational component for more intricate flow representations(10).</p>

<h2 id="challenges-and-limitations">Challenges and Limitations</h2>

<p>The field of multi-scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for oil supply chains faces numerous challenges and limitations that can hinder its effectiveness and widespread adoption.</p>

<h3 id="high-costs-and-resource-limitations">High Costs and Resource Limitations</h3>

<p>One of the most significant obstacles is the high cost associated with technology integration and infrastructure upgrades, which can deter small and medium enterprises from utilizing advanced CFD tools. The financial burden of maintaining and upgrading hardware, particularly as new architectures emerge, can be prohibitive for many organizations(20). Additionally, the need for skilled professionals capable of navigating these complex systems further compounds the issue, leading to reduced operational efficiency and innovation potential(20).</p>

<h3 id="computational-complexity-and-scalability">Computational Complexity and Scalability</h3>

<p>As simulations grow in complexity, particularly when incorporating various scales—from quantum to macro—computational resources must also scale accordingly. The challenge of efficiently managing and processing the vast amounts of data generated by high-fidelity simulations is paramount(19). This necessitates robust data management systems and parallelization techniques for both pre- and post-processing tasks, in order to fully capitalize on the benefits of CFD(19). Furthermore, the transition from CPU to GPU architectures demands that existing CFD algorithms be adapted to maximize performance across heterogeneous computing environments(19).</p>

<h3 id="regulatory-compliance-and-market-saturation">Regulatory Compliance and Market Saturation</h3>
