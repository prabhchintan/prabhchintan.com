            "content_html": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>In the face of ever-increasing global demand for energy, understanding how resources (oil, gas, water, etc.) flow through distribution networks is critical. This blog post presents a <strong>detailed, step-by-step</strong> approach to modeling the distribution of oil from central reserves to various regional and local storage hubs in <em>Wolfram Mathematica</em>. The model reflects hierarchical systems with potential feedback loops, pipeline constraints, friction, and demand mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>By <strong>integrating theoretical, computational, and philosophical underpinnings</strong>, we create a refined framework that goes beyond simplistic representations of Earth’s reserves. This post improves upon an earlier outline, rectifying oversimplified assumptions and providing a more epistemologically sound, falsifiable modeling structure.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"1-motivations-and-goals\">1.

Philosophical and Epistemological Considerations</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"31-falsifiability-and-validation\">3.1 Falsifiability and Validation</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Falsifiable Predictions</strong>: The model’s flow rates and storage volumes can be compared to real data (where available). Significant discrepancies indicate a need to refine assumptions (e.g., friction constants, demand patterns).</li>\n  <li><strong>Transparency in Abstractions</strong>: We explicitly state our simplified assumptions (e.g., ignoring elevation changes, compressibility, or regional geological complexities). This openness allows others to see how the model might break down and to propose enhancements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"32-iterative-refinement\">3.2 Iterative Refinement</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Popperian Feedback Loop</strong>: Begin with a simpler representation (few tanks, uniform friction) and refine based on new data or theoretical insights.</li>\n  <li><strong>Open-Ended Extensions</strong>: Add more layers, incorporate real pipeline geospatial data, or link to external systems (e.g., electricity or production rates) as the model matures.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"4-implementation-in-mathematica\">4.

Then the question became, well, <strong>what is the nature of this world of ideas?</strong> Hegel said <strong>it is reason</strong>. Schopenhauer, who hated Hegel, said <strong>it is will</strong>. Nietzsche said <strong>it is the will to power</strong>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Kant’s Bifurcated World: Phenomena and Noumena</strong></p>\n\n<p>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) proposed a distinction between the world we experience (phenomena) and the world as it truly exists (noumena). He argued that the noumenal world is inaccessible to us directly, as our senses and cognitive faculties impose limitations on how we perceive reality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hegel’s Symphony of Reason: The Dialectic</strong></p>\n\n<p>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) viewed history as a process driven by reason, unfolding through a dialectical process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. He believed that reality is a dynamic interplay of ideas progressing towards a state of absolute knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Schopenhauer’s Willful World: The Primacy of Desire</strong></p>\n\n<p>Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) took a more pessimistic view, emphasizing the irrational force of the will as the driving force behind the universe. He argued that human life is ultimately a struggle against a blind and insatiable will, leading to inevitable suffering.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nietzsche’s Will to Power: Embracing Change</strong></p>\n\n<p>Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) challenged traditional morality and championed the concept of the “will to power.” He argued for the importance of self-overcoming, embracing challenges, and creating one’s own values in an ever-changing world.</p>\n\n<p>The quote in the beginning is from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vKRVpSINsvI?si=A76ir9o9KBSo1azy&amp;t=1190\">a statement by Michael Malice in this clip on YouTube.</a></p>\n",

            "content_html": "<h2 id=\"the-foundation-of-thermodynamics\">The Foundation of Thermodynamics</h2>\n\n<p>Thermodynamics, the branch of physics dealing with heat, temperature, energy, and work, emerged as a distinct field in the 19th century. Its development was crucial for understanding and improving the efficiency of steam engines, which were driving the Industrial Revolution. The roots of thermodynamics can be traced back to the 17th century, with the invention of the first rudimentary heat engines. However, it wasn’t until the 19th century that scientists began to formulate the fundamental principles that would become the laws of thermodynamics.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"key-concepts\">Key Concepts:</h3>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>First Law of Thermodynamics</strong>: This law, also known as the law of conservation of energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. It can be expressed mathematically as:</p>\n\n    <p>ΔU = Q - W</p>\n\n    <p>Where:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>ΔU is the change in internal energy of the system</li>\n      <li>Q is the heat added to the system</li>\n      <li>W is the work done by the system</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>This law was formulated through the work of several scientists, including James Prescott Joule, who demonstrated the mechanical equivalent of heat, and Rudolf Clausius, who gave the first mathematical treatment of the concept.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Second Law of Thermodynamics</strong>: This law introduces the concept of entropy and states that the entropy of an isolated system always increases over time. It can be expressed as:</p>\n\n    <p>ΔS ≥ 0</p>\n\n    <p>Where ΔS is the change in entropy.</p>\n\n    <p>The second law has profound implications. It explains why certain processes occur spontaneously while their reversals do not. For instance, it explains why heat flows from hot to cold objects, but not vice versa.</p>\n\n    <p>This law was developed through the work of Sadi Carnot, who studied the efficiency of heat engines, and later refined by Rudolf Clausius and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics</strong>: Although formulated later, this law is considered more fundamental, hence the name “zeroth”. It states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This law provides the basis for the concept of temperature.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Third Law of Thermodynamics</strong>: This law states that as a system approaches absolute zero temperature, its entropy approaches a constant value. It was formulated by Walther Nernst in the early 20th century and has important implications for low-temperature physics.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The development of thermodynamics had far-reaching consequences beyond the improvement of heat engines. It provided a framework for understanding chemical reactions, phase transitions, and even the behavior of black holes in modern physics.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"james-clerk-maxwell-a-scientific-polymath\">James Clerk Maxwell: A Scientific Polymath</h2>\n\n<p>James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) was a Scottish physicist and mathematician who made fundamental contributions to several fields of science. His work laid the foundation for much of modern physics and engineering.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"early-life-and-education\">Early Life and Education:</h3>\n\n<p>Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Maxwell showed early signs of curiosity and intelligence. At the age of 14, he published his first scientific paper on a method of drawing mathematical curves using a piece of twine. He studied at the University of Edinburgh and later at the University of Cambridge, where he graduated in 1854 with a degree in mathematics.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"key-contributions\">Key Contributions:</h3>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Electromagnetic Theory</strong>: Maxwell’s most famous work unified electricity, magnetism, and light into a single theory, described by Maxwell’s equations. These equations, a set of four fundamental equations, describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents:</p>\n\n    <p>∇ · E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss’s law for electricity)\n∇ · B = 0 (Gauss’s law for magnetism)\n∇ × E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday’s law)\n∇ × B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t) (Ampère-Maxwell law)</p>\n\n    <p>Where:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>E is the electric field</li>\n      <li>B is the magnetic field</li>\n      <li>ρ is the charge density</li>\n      <li>J is the current density</li>\n      <li>ε₀ is the permittivity of free space</li>\n      <li>μ₀ is the permeability of free space</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>These equations predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves traveling at the speed of light, leading to the understanding that light itself is an electromagnetic wave. This discovery paved the way for numerous technological innovations, from radio and television to modern wireless communications.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Kinetic Theory of Gases</strong>: Maxwell developed statistical methods to describe the behavior of gas molecules. He derived the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which describes the distribution of molecular speeds in an ideal gas:</p>\n\n    <p>f(v) = 4π(m/2πkT)³/² v² exp(-mv²/2kT)</p>\n\n    <p>Where:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>f(v) is the probability density function for molecular speed v</li>\n      <li>m is the mass of a molecule</li>\n      <li>k is Boltzmann’s constant</li>\n      <li>T is the absolute temperature</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>This work laid the foundation for statistical mechanics, a branch of physics that explains macroscopic properties of systems based on the statistical behavior of their microscopic components.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Color Vision</strong>: Maxwell made significant advances in understanding color perception and photography. He demonstrated that any color could be produced by mixing red, green, and blue light in appropriate proportions. This discovery laid the groundwork for color photography and modern color displays.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Saturn’s Rings</strong>: Maxwell mathematically demonstrated that Saturn’s rings must be composed of small particles rather than being solid or liquid. This was later confirmed by observations.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Control Theory</strong>: Maxwell’s work on governors for steam engines laid the foundation for control theory, which is crucial in modern engineering and automation.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"legacy\">Legacy:</h3>\n\n<p>Maxwell’s contributions revolutionized physics and paved the way for many of the technological advancements of the 20th and 21st centuries. Albert Einstein described Maxwell’s work as the “most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton.”</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"maxwells-demon-a-thought-experiment\">Maxwell’s Demon: A Thought Experiment</h2>\n\n<p>In 1867, Maxwell proposed a thought experiment that seemed to challenge the Second Law of Thermodynamics. This became known as “Maxwell’s demon” and has intrigued physicists for over 150 years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-concept\">The Concept:</h3>\n\n<p>Imagine a box filled with gas molecules at a uniform temperature, divided into two compartments by a wall with a small door. A tiny intelligent being (the “demon”) operates the door, allowing fast-moving molecules to pass into one compartment and slow-moving molecules into the other.</p>\n\n<p>The demon’s actions would create a temperature difference between the two compartments without expending energy, seemingly violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. This is because temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of molecules, so separating fast (hot) and slow (cold) molecules would create a temperature gradient.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mathematical-description\">Mathematical Description:</h3>\n\n<p>We can describe the change in entropy for this system as:</p>\n\n<p>ΔS = -k_B Σ (p_i ln p_i)</p>\n\n<p>Where:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>ΔS is the change in entropy</li>\n  <li>k_B is Boltzmann’s constant</li>\n  <li>p_i is the probability of the system being in microstate i</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>According to the demon scenario, this value would be negative, contradicting the Second Law of Thermodynamics.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"implications\">Implications:</h3>\n\n<p>The thought experiment raised profound questions about the nature of the Second Law of Thermodynamics:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Is the law truly fundamental, or are there circumstances where it can be violated?</li>\n  <li>What is the role of intelligence or information in thermodynamic processes?</li>\n  <li>How do microscopic and macroscopic behaviors of systems relate?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These questions have led to significant developments in our understanding of the relationships between information, entropy, and energy.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"collaboration-and-controversy\">Collaboration and Controversy</h2>\n\n<p>Maxwell’s thought experiment sparked significant debate and collaboration among scientists, leading to new insights in thermodynamics and eventually in information theory.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"william-thomson-lord-kelvin\">William Thomson (Lord Kelvin):</h3>\n\n<p>William Thomson, better known as Lord Kelvin, was a close friend and collaborator of Maxwell. He was intrigued by the demon concept and contributed significantly to the discussion:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Naming</strong>: Kelvin coined the term “Maxwell’s demon” in 1874, giving the thought experiment its iconic name.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Thermodynamic Discussions</strong>: Kelvin and Maxwell exchanged numerous letters discussing the implications of the demon and the nature of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Heat Death of the Universe</strong>: Kelvin’s work on the “heat death” of the universe, where all energy is evenly distributed and no work can be done, was influenced by these discussions about the fundamental nature of entropy.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"ludwig-boltzmann\">Ludwig Boltzmann:</h3>\n\n<p>Ludwig Boltzmann, an Austrian physicist, made significant contributions to statistical mechanics and was heavily influenced by Maxwell’s work:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Statistical Interpretation</strong>: Boltzmann used Maxwell’s demon to explore the statistical nature of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. He argued that while the law holds on average for large systems, small-scale fluctuations could temporarily decrease entropy.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>H-theorem</strong>: Boltzmann’s H-theorem, which relates the entropy of a gas to the distribution of molecular velocities, was developed in part as a response to the questions raised by Maxwell’s demon.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Loschmidt’s Paradox</strong>: Johann Loschmidt, Boltzmann’s colleague, used the reversibility of microscopic physics to argue against Boltzmann’s statistical explanation of the Second Law, leading to further refinements in the understanding of statistical mechanics.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-contributors\">Other Contributors:</h3>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Marian Smoluchowski</strong>: In the early 20th century, Smoluchowski argued that thermal fluctuations would prevent the demon from operating as Maxwell had imagined, providing an early resolution to the paradox.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Leo Szilard</strong>: In 1929, Szilard connected the demon paradox to information theory, arguing that the demon’s observations and decision-making process must be accounted for in the thermodynamic analysis.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These collaborations and debates surrounding Maxwell’s demon led to significant advancements in our understanding of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and later, information theory.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"resolving-the-paradox\">Resolving the Paradox</h2>\n\n<p>Over the years, various explanations have been proposed to resolve the apparent paradox of Maxwell’s demon. These resolutions have deepened our understanding of the connections between information, entropy, and energy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"information-and-entropy\">Information and Entropy:</h3>\n\n<p>In the mid-20th century, scientists began to explore the relationship between information and thermodynamics, providing new insights into the Maxwell’s demon paradox:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Léon Brillouin</strong>: In 1951, Brillouin argued that the demon would need to use light to observe the molecules, and this process would increase entropy, compensating for any decrease caused by sorting the molecules.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Dennis Gabor</strong>: Working independently, Gabor made similar arguments about the thermodynamic cost of information acquisition.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Information Entropy</strong>: Claude Shannon’s development of information theory in the 1940s provided a framework for quantifying information, which proved crucial in understanding the demon paradox.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"landauers-principle\">Landauer’s Principle:</h3>\n\n<p>In 1961, Rolf Landauer proposed a principle that became key to resolving the Maxwell’s demon paradox:</p>\n\n<p>Landauer’s Principle states that erasing one bit of information requires a minimum amount of energy, generating heat and thus increasing entropy:</p>\n\n<p>ΔS = k_B ln(2)</p>\n\n<p>Where:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>ΔS is the change in entropy</li>\n  <li>k_B is Boltzmann’s constant</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This principle connects information theory directly to thermodynamics, providing a physical basis for the cost of information processing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bennetts-resolution\">Bennett’s Resolution:</h3>\n\n<p>In 1982, Charles Bennett of IBM Research applied Landauer’s principle to Maxwell’s demon:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Measurement Without Energy Cost</strong>: Bennett showed that the demon could, in principle, measure the molecules’ speeds without expending energy.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Memory Erasure</strong>: However, the demon would need to store this information, and eventually, its memory would fill up. To continue operating, it would need to erase its memory.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Entropy Increase</strong>: The erasure of the demon’s memory, according to Landauer’s principle, would increase entropy by at least as much as the demon had decreased it by sorting the molecules.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This resolution preserves the Second Law of Thermodynamics by accounting for the full thermodynamic cycle of the demon’s operation, including information storage and erasure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"modern-implications-and-research\">Modern Implications and Research</h2>\n\n<p>Maxwell’s demon continues to inspire research in various fields, bridging fundamental physics, information theory, and emerging technologies:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Quantum Computing</strong>:\n    <ul>\n      <li>The concept has implications for the thermodynamics of information in quantum systems.</li>\n      <li>Researchers are exploring how quantum effects might influence the operation of Maxwell’s demon-like systems.</li>\n      <li>Some have proposed quantum versions of Maxwell’s demon that exploit quantum superposition and entanglement.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Nanoscale Devices</strong>:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Researchers have created molecular-scale “demons” that can separate particles or molecules.</li>\n      <li>In 2016, scientists at Simon Fraser University created a physical version of Maxwell’s demon using a single electron box.</li>\n      <li>These nanoscale experiments help to verify and refine our understanding of the interplay between information and thermodynamics at the microscopic level.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Biophysics</strong>:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Some biological processes, like ATP synthase, have been compared to Maxwell’s demon.</li>\n      <li>ATP synthase is an enzyme that creates the energy storage molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Its operation involves the selective transport of protons across a membrane, reminiscent of the demon’s sorting of molecules.</li>\n      <li>Studying these biological “demons” could lead to insights in both biology and physics.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Information Engines</strong>:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Researchers are developing and studying “information engines” that convert information into work.</li>\n      <li>These devices, while not violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics, demonstrate how information can be used as a resource in thermodynamic systems.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Feedback Control</strong>:\n    <ul>\n      <li>The study of Maxwell’s demon has influenced the development of feedback control systems in engineering.</li>\n      <li>These systems use information about a system’s state to guide its behavior, much like the demon uses information about molecule speeds.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Foundations of Physics</strong>:\n    <ul>\n      <li>The demon concept continues to inspire discussions about the foundations of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.</li>\n      <li>It raises questions about the nature of irreversibility and the arrow of time in physics.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Impact</strong>:\n    <ul>\n      <li>The demon paradox and its resolution have influenced fields beyond physics, including computer science, philosophy of science, and even aspects of cognitive science dealing with the physical basis of information processing in the brain.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Maxwell’s demon, while initially seeming to challenge fundamental laws of physics, has led to deeper insights into the connections between information, entropy, and energy. It demonstrates how thought experiments can drive scientific progress and inspire new areas of research, even more than 150 years after their conception.</p>\n\n<p>The journey from Maxwell’s original idea to modern nanoscale experiments and quantum information theory showcases the power of theoretical physics to spark practical innovations. It also highlights the interconnected nature of physics, where concepts from thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, quantum theory, and information theory converge to deepen our understanding of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>As we continue to push the boundaries of technology and scientific understanding, Maxwell’s demon remains a touchstone for exploring the fundamental limits of information processing and energy manipulation. Its legacy serves as a reminder of the profound insights that can arise from seemingly simple questions about the nature of heat and motion.</p>\n",

This is important to put in context because while this was going on, my peers, both in India and the US, were saying things like, “I just got a job at Goldman Sachs!” and “Just got back from a shopping trip to Dubai!” - while both my parents and I were working minimum wage jobs to pay rent and put food on the table. My active listening and questioning skills were molded by necessity rather than born out of curiosity.</p>\n\n<p>In parallel, I struggled through university and finally lucked my way into a job at one of the big companies, Shell! But there was a catch: I was to show up at the oil refinery every day at 5 AM. This meant I had to wake up at 3, since it was at the very opposite edge of the city, at the Port of Houston. This also meant I had to change how I spent my free time, stop going out the night before, etc. - but I was ready to give this opportunity my all.</p>\n\n<p>At this “big boy white collar job at the refinery”, like all newcomers, I was given tedious tasks nobody wanted. I measured stairs for compliance, installed whiteboards that nobody ever used, and made reports that got the messenger shot, the usual. I did my best and was soon promoted to bean counter: I had to match the amount of oil we had on hand with what the computer said we had. In other words, inventory reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>I remember actively listening and asking (way too many) open-ended questions that some were supportive of but most just found annoying. I was often mockingly called “the scribe”, for example, for asking questions and noting down the answers in my notebook (reminds me of notes-shaming on Twitter, lol!). But this process has its upside: by repeatedly doing this, I eventually understood how the entire place worked! And not just on paper, I knew the mechanics and dynamics of each machine, which person did what, what problems each department had, which problems were unique to the refinery, and which ones were commonplace in the industry, you name it. It was like learning to speak a second language; it sounds like gibberish and one day you catch yourself speaking it - as long as you really listen and ask naive questions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-do-you-approach-decision-making-in-uncertain-business-environments\"><strong>How do you approach decision-making in uncertain business environments?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>When the path is uncertain, the approach becomes risk-based. There are a few things to keep in mind:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Kelly criterion</strong>: optimal size of bet an investor (or gambler) should place to maximize expected value - developed by John Larry Kelly Jr., a researcher at Bell Labs, in 1956. In other words, split your resources into asymmetric fractals across time and space. “Hedge your bets” but dynamically.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Path dependence</strong>: your path is not the sum of all paths. Maybe I’ll expand on this one in a future post but for now, I’ll leave it at this.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Simpson’s paradox</strong>: individuals and groups may have opposite characteristics at their respective scales.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My personal experience of Simpson’s Paradox: weirdly, I <em>benefitted</em> from the FTX crash. Path dependence: the group has a different path than the individual, which have different paths from each other.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-you-provide-an-example-of-a-challenging-ethical-dilemma-you-faced-as-a-business-leader-and-how-you-resolved-it\"><strong>Can you provide an example of a challenging ethical dilemma you faced as a business leader and how you resolved it?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>While doing oil inventory, I noticed this was an industry-wide problem - that inventory never matched the numbers in the computer. This was an ethical dilemma because it meant millions, potentially billions of dollars worth of accounts were being misreported. That had massive ramifications.</p>\n\n<p>I resolved it by working on the problem until I fully understood it more than anyone else (to my knowledge), and making others aware of why it was such a big deal. This took infinite debates and conversations, but this was what got me funded to go fix it, and fix it I did! With AI before it was cool, in 2018. But then it got taken over by McKinsey people and the like, so now I work on other things. Feels good that I conquered it, though.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-you-share-an-experience-where-philosophical-principles-such-as-existentialism-or-stoicism-helped-you-navigate-a-challenging-situation\"><strong>Can you share an experience where philosophical principles, such as existentialism or stoicism, helped you navigate a challenging situation?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Without knowing anything about it prior, I joined a DecafQuest class out of curiosity the day after quitting my job - seemed like the right time to look into the big questions, which I had never done before. I’m glad I did because I now have a basic working knowledge of a lot of Philosophy and Physics. It’s a great experience and the learning aspect is real - it’s surely one of the best investments I made.</p>\n\n<p>The situation of purposefully quitting my job was quite challenging for me, but in retrospect, I prepared well and was lucky via circumstance to learn from everyone I looked up to and mimicked in my professional life. I owe big thanks to Joe Norman, Nassim Taleb, and Sahil Lavingia for amazing insights that are lifelong lessons worth their weight in gold.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-do-you-foster-a-growth-mindset-and-encourage-continuous-learning-among-your-team-members\"><strong>How do you foster a growth mindset and encourage continuous learning among your team members?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Decentralize ownership and move it to the edges. Let everyone be their own boss as much as possible. This includes “letting them fail.” I learned this at Apple but applied it best at Shell.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-you-provide-an-example-of-a-time-when-your-team-successfully-adapted-to-a-significant-change\"><strong>Can you provide an example of a time when your team successfully adapted to a significant change?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>When McKinsey people took over the oil inventory project I mentioned, which was near and dear to my heart, it felt like a significant change. It was like having a “professional CEO” given to a founder (something I only later learned was commonplace). Me and my team were being told it was an upgrade but everything about it felt like a downgrade.</p>\n\n<p>We discussed it internally and came up with a weird strategy; we managed this change by open-sourcing our project. In other words, instead of hiding information, code, and subject matter expertise, we put it all out in public for anyone and everyone to use. This worked out because all the engineers I led went on to get amazing next jobs and the McKinsey consultants got to have their victory laps. Win-win. Best of both worlds. I managed this transition for about 6 or so months and announced that I will leave once the handover was finished. I even got to play VC for a bit, which maybe was their way of making me want to stay, but I thought it was incredibly boring and zero-sum so I left to do other things.</p>\n\n<p>Later that year, while attending Real World Risk Institute, I learned that this experience of a nifty innovation being taken over by “professionals” was not a special case, but it’s how innovation has worked throughout history - and it’s the outcome new, useful things almost always face.</p>\n\n<p><em>You can hear the more detailed audio version of this interview here:</em></p>\n\n<center><div class=\"video-container\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TiGWvpexZU8?si=7EOvPjtA1tItN7Q-\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></center>\n",
